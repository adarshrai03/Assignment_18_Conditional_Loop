Conditional statements in JavaScript are used to make decisions in your code based on whether a certain condition is true or false. The most common types of conditional statements in JavaScript are:

1. if statement:
	if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
	}
 Example :
 let x = 10;
	if (x > 5) {
    	console.log("x is greater than 5");
	}

2. if-else statement:
	Syntax:
	if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
	} else {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is false
	}

Example : 
	let x = 3;
	if (x > 5) {
    console.log("x is greater than 5");
	} 
	else {
    console.log("x is not greater than 5");
	}

3. if-else if-else statement:
	Syntax : 
	let x = 5;

	if (x > 5) {
    console.log("x is greater than 5");
	}
	else if (x < 5) {
    console.log("x is less than 5");
	} 
	else {
    console.log("x is equal to 5");
	}
